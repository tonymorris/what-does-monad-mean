    Moggi first described monads for use in structuring programs <biblioref linkend="MoggiMonads"/>. Philip Wadler and
    Simon Peyton-Jones have worked further with the concept on introducing them to purely functional programming
    languages.

  <para>
    It is often said that monads are specific to functional programming. This is not true. Indeed, the term
    <quote>functional programming</quote> is itself quite a misnomer. It's simply practical programming and the thesis
    is composition and abstraction (see <biblioref linkend="WhyFP"/>). Monads are used in every single programming
    language. The only distinction is whether  or not the user is aware of the fact.

    This presentation will set aside the myths and present you with a concrete understanding of a rather simple concept
    that is easy to understand, but with far reaching implications. If the objectives of this presentation are met, you
    will be equipped to take advantage of this concept in your every-day programming and explore those implications
    further.
